** Motivation
*** Sharing across databases
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
		- Information on relational databases is hard to share
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
			- Different format, schema and access control
			- Sharing problems cause data to become outdated
		- A different approach is needed


#+LaTeX: \note{
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Relational databases are a closed source of information, which makes it hard to
share

Duplicating the shared data on all databases does not makes much sense
 and it can easily become stale as it won't be maintained by the real owner
#+END_NOTES
#+LaTeX: }

*** A Web-like approach
		The Web provides linked documents with human readable information

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
		- Documents are linked
			- Real owners can update the data
			- Documents can be navigated across different servers
		- It's distributed
			- Can scale-out

** Linked Data
*** One Database to rule them all
		LD movement proposes using a graph made of IRIs and strings

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
		- Uses links to data instead of copies
		- Uses IRIs as data identifiers
		- Uses IRIs as relation identifiers
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
			- And suggests collection of relations to use

#+LaTeX: \note{
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Following the web, LD proposes using a graph, but instead of documents and
links, it explicitly uses identifiers as things rather than only identifiers of
documents
#+END_NOTES
#+LaTeX: }

** RDF
*** TODO Resource Description Framework
		Defines the layout of the data

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
		- An RDF triple is a tuple $(S, P, O)$
			- $Subject$   is an IRI representing something
			- $Predicate$ is an IRI representing a relation
			- $Object$    might be an IRI or a string of data
		- It's essentially the unit of information

#+LaTeX: \note{
#+BEGIN_NOTES
RDF is a specification on of the data layout
An RDF triple is the essential unit of information, it relates some objects
using a predicate.
A key point is using IRIs and having a standardized set of IRIs to do so
#+END_NOTES
#+LaTeX: }

** SPARQL
*** SPARQL query language
		A SQL-like language for querying graph databases

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
		- Servers provide
			- An SPARQL endpoint to consume or update RDF data
			- A store for the data
		- Querying multiple servers is hard
			- Query federation allows specifying multiple servers
				- Queries are hard to write
				- Lacks discoverability

#+LaTeX: \note{
#+BEGIN_NOTES
SPARQL is a query language that mimics SQL to query graphs
#+END_NOTES
#+LaTeX: }

* Navigational Queries
** Navigation
*** Searching data the way you browse for it

** Automata
*** Definition
		A SQL-like language for querying graph databases

    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
		- Servers provide
*** Heuristic
** Search
*** Advantages
**** Shortest path proves relation
*** A* speed up using query information
** Implementation details
*** Heuristic
** Evaluation
*** Experiment setup

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Imagine you are given a flash drive with the contents of the internet, but at
the cost of not having internet anymore. Would that be useful?
Great part of the value of the internet is on being able to access living
information. Most of the information on that flash drive will become irrelevant
or stale
Databases face a similar problem, they don't usually have access to the outside
world.
